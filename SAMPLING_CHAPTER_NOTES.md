# Sampling Chapter Conversion Notes

## Overview
This document provides information about the conversion of the Sampling chapter from R Markdown to PreTeXt format.

## Image Placeholders

The Sampling chapter includes references to two figures that are dynamically generated using R code in the original .Rmd file:

1. **Figure 7.2.1** (sec-sampling-error): `placeholder_sampling_distribution.png`
   - Shows the sampling distribution of the mean over 5000 random samples from NHANES
   - Originally generated by R code in lines 72-117 of 07-Sampling.Rmd
   - Displays blue histogram of sample means overlaid on gray histogram of population

2. **Figure 7.4.1** (sec-central-limit-theorem): `placeholder_alcohol_sampling_distribution.png`
   - Shows distribution of AlcoholYear variable and its sampling distribution
   - Originally generated by R code in lines 141-179 of 07-Sampling.Rmd
   - Two-panel figure: left shows skewed distribution, right shows normal sampling distribution

## To Generate These Images

To complete the PreTeXt version with actual images, you would need to:

1. Run the R code from the original .Rmd file
2. Save the generated plots as PNG files with the placeholder names
3. Place the images in the appropriate directory (as specified in publication.ptx)
4. Verify the images render correctly in the HTML build

## Alternative Approach

Alternatively, you could:
- Use the existing images from the built HTML/PDF versions of the rmd book
- Extract figures from the _book directory if available
- Re-run the full rmd build and extract the generated figures

## Content Completeness

Despite the placeholder images, the **text content is 100% complete** and includes:
- All explanatory text
- All mathematical formulas
- All tables with data
- Descriptive captions for all figures
- Accessible descriptions of what each figure shows

The placeholder images do not affect the completeness of the content conversion - they are simply awaiting the technical step of running the R code to generate the actual image files.
