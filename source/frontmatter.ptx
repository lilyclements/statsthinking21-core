  <p>
    The goal of this book is to the tell the story of statistics as it is used today by researchers around the world. 
    It's a different story than the one told in most introductory statistics books, which focus on teaching how to use 
    a set of tools to achieve very specific goals. This book focuses on understanding the basic ideas of <em>statistical 
    thinking</em> <mdash/> a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and use data to make decisions 
    and predictions, all in the context of the inherent uncertainty that exists in the real world.

    <title>The golden age of data</title>
    <p>
      Throughout this book we use examples from real data whenever possible. This is now very easy because we are 
      swimming in open datasets, as governments, scientists, and companies are increasingly making data freely available.

    <title>The importance of doing statistics</title>
    <p>
      The only way to really learn statistics is to <em>do</em> statistics. While historically many statistics courses 
      were taught using point-and-click statistical software, it is increasingly common for statistical education to 
      use open-source languages in which students can code their own analyses.
