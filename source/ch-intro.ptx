    <title>What is statistical thinking?</title>
    <p>
      Statistical thinking is a way of understanding a complex world by describing it in relatively simple terms 
      that nonetheless capture essential aspects of its structure or function, and that also provide us some idea 
      of how uncertain we are about that knowledge.

    <title>What can statistics do for us?</title>
    <p>
      There are three major things that we can do with statistics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Describe:</em> The world is complex and we often need to describe it in a simplified way.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Decide:</em> We often need to make decisions based on data, in the face of uncertainty.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Predict:</em> We often wish to make predictions about new situations based on our knowledge.</p></li>
    </ul>
